SourcePunish core - plugin for SourceMod. Handles sm_add command for starting punishments, automatic removal of punishments, logging everything in the database, etc.
Web panel - made in PHP. Basically a DB frontend for history which is also capable of starting/ending punishments (user would need to be logged in as authorised server admin)
Punishment plugins - plugins for SourceMod that provide add punishment/remove punishment callbacks and punishment type strings to SourcePunish plugin

sm_add <type> <target> <time> <reason>
<Azelphur> when a plugin loads, it'd notify the core of it's name, along with it's add and remove callbacks

See SourceIRC for how a plugin might have it's own plugins (SourceIRC just connects to IRC, joins channels and responds to ping. everything else is done by plugins)

Support for multi-server setups: share DB and web panel between servers.

Example punishment: 'user cannot create props' in FortWars

<Alex> You said the web panel was going to add/remove punishments - how? rcon?
<Azelphur> Alex: could do that, yea
<Alex> did you have any other ideas in mind?
<Azelphur> perhaps a direct connection (probably more reliable)
<Alex> direct connection?
<Alex> can you be more specific? xD
<Azelphur> yea, just like a simple TCP/telnet style connection
<Alex> So the core sourcepunish plugin on the server will listen for TCP connections, and if a certain secret is entered the client will be able to run commands?
<Azelphur> Alex: something like that, I wonder how SourceBans do it
<Azelphur> would be good to look at that :)
